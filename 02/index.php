									The cream is called <a href="<?=$lifecell_link?>">LifeCell</a>, and since its been released, it has been raved about by numerous celebrities such as Paula Abdul, Melora Hardin, Paris Hilton, Cheryl Hines, Tom Arnold, Jennifer Taylor, and Felicity Huffman.
								</p>
								<p>
									Paula Abdul - "Wow, it works!" <br>
									Paris Hilton - "I simply love it!"
								</p>
								<p>
									What especially got our attention is its touted by doctors as the world's first ALL-IN-ONE Anti-Aging Treatment.
									It works as a fast acting anti-wrinkle cream, firming cream, 24 hour moisturizer, age-spot reducer, corrective under-eye treatment, and make-up base.

With all this attention and hype, we interviewed many Beauty Experts, as well as many customers of LifeCell, to determine if it really lives up to its claims.

								<div class="post_title">Bobbie Pollard's story:</div>
								<div style="float: left; padding: 0px 5px 5px 0px;"><img src="images/bobbie_pollards_photo.png"/>
								</div>
								<div>
									Here is what Bobbie Pollard, who is both a Beauty Expert (she is one of the most sought after licensed cosmetologists in Las Vegas, specializing in Bridal Makeup), as well as a LifeCell user, has to say:
								</div>
								<p>
									"When new clients come to me... they have only a few short weeks before they are to get married. They don't have time to be put on a skin care regimen for months at end before they see the disappearance of their lines and wrinkles.
								</p>
								<p>
									Most of them are screaming "I need laser therapy, Botox, Collagen - do something quick!!"
								</p>
								<p>
									But when they find out about the pain and costs involved with those invasive procedures, most realize it's not for them.
								<span class="for_bold">
									What they really want is a safe, easy to apply facial treatment
								</span>, if one even exists, that they can use at home that really works, <span class="for_underline">
									that would zap 5 to 10 years from their facial appearance very quickly!</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									In my quest to satisfy my client's need, I've tried almost all anti-wrinkle creams, and constantly speak to research scientists about the latest ingredients they contain. Most of the anti-wrinkle creams do not lessen wrinkles or improve skin texture, let alone fulfill the more extravagant promises on the label.
								</p>
								<p>
									However, one skin care product that truly stands out in my mind is called <span class="for_link">LifeCell.</span>
								</p>

								<p>
                                                                    <span class="for_bold">I have to admit, when I first heard my friends raving and ranting about this new skin care breakthrough, I was a skeptical. There was only one way to find out: try it myself. So I did.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									First it felt a bit warm, then it felt a bit tight. Finally, it felt as if it was being gently tweaked backwards. It was unnerving. I could actually feel the plumpness around my eye. It felt more firm.
								</p>
								<p>
									My friend Christine was with me and she was convinced that my face had
                                                                        lifted. To my astonishment, so was I. If it can do that in a matter of a few minutes,
                                                                        what might an ongoing course achieve? What might I look
                                                                        like after a couple of months? I was excited.
								</p>
								<p>
									On doing some research I realized <a href="<?=$lifecell_link?>">LifeCell</a> is an "all-in-one cream" that reduces the appearances of wrinkles, lines, crow's feet, dark-circles, age-spots, puffy eyes, frown lines, sagging skin, and "feather" lips. There is nothing quite like it in the market for whatever amount of money.
								</p>
								<p>
									Why? Because it's loaded with antioxidants, water-binding agents, and anti-irritants. A staggering amount of scientific research has proven without a doubt that these <a class="openPopup" title="Anti-aging Ingredients" name="anti_aging_ingredients">anti-aging ingredients </a>are extremely beneficial to reduce the tell-tale signs of aging on our skin.
								Ever since I've started applying <a href="<?=$lifecell_link?>">LifeCell</a>, I can't stop getting complimented enough on how radiant and youthful my skin looks and feels.
								</p>
								<p>
									And I feel my long search for the perfect anti-wrinkle cream for my clients and myself has finally been met. Now, all I have to do is hand my clients a tube of <a href="<?=$lifecell_link?>">LifeCell</a> and tell them to apply it for a few short days. Viola! Most of them have to pinch themselves to believe the dramatic results they see in the mirror.
								</p>
								<p>
									When I give my clients a tube of <a href="<?=$lifecell_link?>">LifeCell</a> I tell them, "Stop lying about your age, boast about it - and smile when their jaws drop in amazement... Jump out of bed in the morning, and see yourself a decade younger in the mirror."

								"I am 87 years old. I was born during World War I. And if I had a dollar for every anti-wrinkle and anti-aging product that I've used during the last 87 years that did not work, I would probably have enough money to buy a skin care company and make a product that actually did work. "
							</p>
							<p>
								Well, I don't have the dollars, but I did find a product that actually works. After so many disappointments, I've become a complete cynic when it comes to anti-wrinkle and anti-aging systems, but LifeCell really restored my faith.
							</p>
							<p>
								It's a good, old-fashioned "get what you pay for" type of, all-in-one, anti-aging skin care system. That's just so convenient. Besides, the price tag for LifeCell is a lot less painful than an injection.It's tough to make 87 year old skin look younger and I know because I've tried all the products available. After using LifeCell for about 2 months my skin now looks and feels like that of a 65-year old. I can whole-heartedly say that I would recommend LifeCell to anyone who wanted to look younger."

								My name is Maurio Coito and I'm 45 years old. I have been a flight attendant for the last 20 year.
							</p>
							<p>
								Because of the radiation and stress of long cross Atlantic flights I get dark circles under my eyes, and blemishes on my skin. As I get older, my skin does not bounce back so quickly, from the stress and crows feet have started to show... and my darks circles now have bags.
							</p>
							<p>
								Then a friend of mine introduced me to LifeCell. I was skeptical because I was not looking for oceans of lotions to work on my face. I don't have time for that kind of aggravation. Too many other skin care treatments just did not work for me.
							</p>
							<p>
								I only have one face and I want to care for it the best way I can. I wanted something that would reduce my pores, lighten the appearance of my dark circles and blemishes, soften the texture of my skin and reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles that are age telling.
