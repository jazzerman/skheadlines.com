        A Snapshot Of Some Of LifeCell's Key Anti-Aging Ingredients

                        Anti-Inflammatory & Anti-Oxidant (D3PA)
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        D3PA is a universal antioxidant which fights free-radicals known to wrinkles.
                        Free-radicals cause wrinkles by attacking and damaging healthy skin cells.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         D3PA has explosively more staying power than any other antioxidant and is a key ingredient in LifeCell.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Applying Deanol on skin helps produce acetycholine causing skin to firm and the muscles underneath to tone-up.
                        Long-term use of Deanol helps to permanently achieve a leaner look because the muscle tone in our face improves.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Better Than Collagen Injections?
                        Clinical studies show Deanol actually helps increase circulation and tone to the lips, creating a fuller, firmer appearance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the more spectacular anti-aging effects of Deanol, is the natural lift it could produce in the eyelids in just a few days of use.

						Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad) discovered a groundbreaking compound called Nitric Oxide.  
						Nitric Oxide dilates our capillaries and increases healthy blood circulation to our skin.

				<span class="for_bold">How so?</span>  Well, Nitric Oxide helps dilate our capillaries and increases
				healthy blood circulation to our skin. The enhanced circulation helps
				bring with it a flood of nutrients saturating our malnourished
				skin...with new life.			
			<h2>				
				Bingo!  Our Face Ends Up
				Regaining Its Bright Youthful Bloom!				
			</h2>
				But Nitric Oxide cannot be given directly to our skin since it is a
				gas. Instead, it has to be produced on the surface of our skin through
				a naturally produced compound in our bodies called
				<span class="for_bold">Dithiolane-3-Pentanoic Acid</span>...also known in short as D3PA.  D3PA
				levels decrease as we age. However, worry not. A high concentration of
				D3PA is included in anti-aging LifeCell.
			<p class="for_bold">
				In clinical research conducted by a doctor from Yale University's
				Medical School, on D3PA's effects...his patients noticed a "healthy
				glow" within five days of application.  This is expected given D3PA's
				ability to help produce Nitric Oxide.
			</p>
				And the marvelous effects of D3PA don't end here. D3PA is also a
				<span class="for_underline">universal</span> <span class="for_underline">antioxidant</span>...that vanquishes free-radicals known to cause
				ugly wrinkles.
